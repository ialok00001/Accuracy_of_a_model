# Accuracy_of_a_model

This is just a small write-up on the kinds of metrics available and when and where to use them in a machine learning model. I wrote this in my B.Sc. last semester while going through my Data Mining and Machine Learning course. It only covers the classification types of models, since that have more kinds of metrics and all of them have a unique interpretation about the model and data.

This write-up was initially written for my own understanding. It contains parts of books' definitions and parts of my own insights.
